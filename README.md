## 👨‍💻 About Me

🇵🇭🇸🇬
🎓 Bachelor of Information Technology in Cyber Security & Forensics and Business Information Systems  
📍 Murdoch University Singapore (Graduating: April 2025)

Since I was a kid, I’ve been passionate about computers, fascinated by how they work and the possibilities they create. As I grew older, I discovered the world of hacking and cybersecurity, which sparked my desire to pursue a career in IT. Cybersecurity excites me because it blends problem-solving with the critical role of protecting systems, and I find it both challenging and rewarding.

I am a self-motivated and enthusiastic IT undergraduate with a passion for cybersecurity, digital forensics, and business intelligence. My experience spans across academic projects, foundational programming, and practical tools, giving me the expertise to contribute to dynamic teams. I am eager to start my career and contribute to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.
