## 👨‍💻 About Me

📍 Singapore 🇸🇬  
📍 Murdoch University Singapore (Graduated: May 2025)  
🎓 Bachelor of Information Technology in Cyber Security & Forensics and Business Information Systems  


Since I was a kid, I’ve been passionate about computers, fascinated by how they work and the possibilities they create. As I grew older, I discovered the world of hacking and cybersecurity, which sparked my desire to pursue a career in IT. Cybersecurity excites me because it blends problem-solving with the critical role of protecting systems, and I find it both challenging and rewarding.

I'm a self-motivated and enthusiastic IT graduate with a passion for cybersecurity and digital forensics. I have a solid foundation in cybersecurity, digital forensics and business information systems, complemented by practical experience gained through academic research and industry-relevant projects. I am eager to start my career and contribute to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.
